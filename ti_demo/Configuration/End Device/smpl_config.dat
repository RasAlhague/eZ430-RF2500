// Number of connections supported. each connection supports bi-directional
// communication.  Access Points and Range Extenders can set this to 0 if they
// do not host End Devices.
-DNUM_CONNECTIONS=2

// size of low level queues for sent and received frames. affects RAM usage

// AP needs larger input frame queue if it is supporting store-and-forward
// clients because the forwarded messages are held here. two is probably enough
// for an End Device
-DSIZE_INFRAME_Q=2

// the output frame queue can be small since Tx is done synchronously. if
// an Access Point device is also hosting an End Device that sends to a sleeping
// peer the output queue should be larger -- the waiting frames in this case
// are held here. in that case the output frame queue should be bigger. actually
// 1 is probably enough.
-DSIZE_OUTFRAME_Q=2

// this device's address. the first byte is used as a filter on the CC1100/CC2500
// radios so THE FIRST BYTE MUST NOT BE either 0x00 or 0xFF. also, for these radios
// on End Devices the first byte should be the least significant byte so the filtering
// is maximally effective. otherwise the frame has to be processed by the MCU before it
// is recognized as not intended for the device. APs and REs run in promiscuous mode so
// the filtering is not done. this macro intializes a static const array of unsigned
// characters of length NET_ADDR_SIZE (found in nwk_types.h). the quotes (") are
// necessary below unless the spaces are removed.
-DTHIS_DEVICE_ADDRESS="{0x77, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12}"

-DEND_DEVICE

// For End Devices we need to specify the Rx type. Uncomment the appropriate
// macro definition below. This field is used by the Access Point in networks
// containing an AP to know whether to reserve store-and-forward support for
// the joing End Device.
//
// For sleeping devices that do _not_ poll use RX_ALWAYS.
//
// For EDs that only send use RX_ALWAYS and not RX_NEVER. The RX_NEVER support
// is currently incomplete. It is inteneded to support devcies that can not send
// as opposed to devices that can but do not send.
